# Privacy Policy

**Introduction**

This Data Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how Mother Goose (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and safeguards the personal information of our users. We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users and ensuring that their information is kept confidential.

**Types of Information Collected**

We collect two types of information through our app:

1.  Personal Information: Personal information is any information that can be used to identify an individual, such as a name and date of birth. This information is collected when a user sets up a profile within the app. The profile should be setup using the details of the patent or guardian and NOT the child/children using the app. If you find a child has provided personal information to the app please contact us and we will immediately remove it from our databases.
2.  Usage Data: Usage data is information about how the app is used, including the frequency of use and the features used. This information is collected through analytics tools and is used to improve our app and to provide personalized experiences for our users.

**Purpose of Collecting Information**

The personal information we collect is used to generate personalized stories for each child. The usage data we collect is used to improve our app and to provide a better experience for our users. We may also use the information we collect to communicate with our users, such as sending updates and promotions.

**Data Sharing and Disclosures**

We do not sell, trade, or rent any personal information collected through our app to third parties. Any information we collect is used solely for the purpose of generating personalized stories for each child.

**Service providers**

To offer our service we integrate with some third parties to provide some particular capability.

We employ state-of-the-art security measures to ensure that our users’ information is protected and kept confidential. Our servers are secured with encryption and firewalls to prevent unauthorized access to our users’ information.

**Data Retention**

We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the services requested by our users. After this period, the information is deleted from our servers.

**Children’s Privacy**

Mother Goose is committed to protecting the privacy of children. We comply with all applicable data privacy laws, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which requires us to obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children under the age of 13.

**Changes to this Policy**

We reserve the right to make changes to this Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page and will become effective immediately upon posting. We encourage our users to regularly review this Policy to stay informed about our privacy practices.
